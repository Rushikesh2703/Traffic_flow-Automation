    "### How This Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Each Signal Has:**\n",
    "   - Default min/max timing limits (10-60 seconds)\n",
    "   - Current green time duration\n",
    "   - List of neighbors and their last reported status\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Three Key Methods:**\n",
    "   - `update_neighbor_status()`: Receives congestion updates (\"low/medium/high\")\n",
    "   - `calculate_green_time()`: Determines new timing based on:\n",
    "     - Its own congestion level\n",
    "     - Neighbors' congestion levels\n",
    "   - Makes adjustments (+5s for helping congested neighbors, -2s when neighbors are clear)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sample Simulation Shows:**\n",
    "   - Initial state: All signals at normal timing\n",
    "   - When Signal 1 becomes congested:\n",
    "     - Signal 2 increases its time to help (35 → ~40s)\n",
    "     - Signal 3 makes minor adjustment based on Signal 2's status\n",
    "   - All signals stay within safe limits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Logic:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if neighbor == \"high\":\n",
    "    my_time += 5  # Help congested neighbor\n",
    "elif neighbor == \"low\":\n",
    "    my_time -= 2  # Reduce time when neighbor is clear\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates the core coordination logic where signals automatically adjust to help each other based on real-time congestion updates."
