    "### Basic Concept:\n",
    "Each traffic signal constantly monitors its own congestion and shares this info with its neighbors. When it receives updates from neighbors, it adjusts its timing to help balance traffic flow across the whole area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works Step-by-Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Each Signal Knows Its Neighbors**\n",
    "   - When you start the system, you tell each signal who its neighbors are (like Signal 1 knows Signals 2 and 3 are its neighbors)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Constant Monitoring**\n",
    "   - Each signal counts vehicles at its intersection every second\n",
    "   - Determines if congestion is Low/Medium/High based on vehicle count\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sharing Updates**\n",
    "   - Every second, each signal sends messages like:\n",
    "     *\"Hey Neighbor! I'm Signal 1, my congestion is High, and traffic is coming your way (incoming)\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Making Adjustments**\n",
    "   When a signal gets updates from neighbors, it changes its timing like this:\n",
    "   - **If neighbor has HIGH congestion** and traffic is coming your way:\n",
    "     *Increase your green time* → Helps clear their backlog\n",
    "   - **If neighbor has LOW congestion** and traffic is going away from you:\n",
    "     *Decrease your green time* → Lets other busier signals get more time\n",
    "   - Uses simple math: Base time (from its own traffic) + Adjustments (from neighbors)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Safety Limits**\n",
    "   - Never goes below minimum (e.g., 10 seconds)\n",
    "   - Never goes above maximum (e.g., 70 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal 1 (Congestion: High) → Signal 2:\n",
    "- Signal 2 sees: \"Signal 1 is jammed and traffic is coming my way\"\n",
    "- Signal 2 responds: \"I'll stay green longer to help clear Signal 1's traffic\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Signal 3 (Congestion: Low) → Signal 2:\n",
    "- Signal 2 sees: \"Signal 3 is clear and traffic is moving away\"\n",
    "- Signal 2 responds: \"I can reduce my green time since Signal 3 doesn't need help\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Decision:\n",
    "Signal 2 combines:\n",
    "- Its own traffic count\n",
    "- Signal 1's \"help needed\" message (+5 seconds)\n",
    "- Signal 3's \"all clear\" message (-2 seconds)\n",
    "= Final timing adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, all signals work together like a team to keep traffic flowing smoothly across multiple intersections!"
